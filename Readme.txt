HOW TO USE LOCALLY ON YOUR MACHINE
1- download Xampp tool and check that Apache is started on it
2- copy this code in C:\xampp\htdocs folder on another htdocs subfolder
3- Browse to localhost\subdomainNameYouGave
You should see the dashboard !

Other notes:
4- Enter the Account Admin APIs (stats could be missing with other API permissions)
5- if you get a php timeout, due to large account, you can increase the value of max_execution_time in php.ini file
